*****Screen 3  <--Reached by selecting "Continue" button on Screen 2
This will function as a progress screen.  It should have the following fields, and be updated as each API call is made, returns successfully, etc.
TITLE text "Action" on the column of actions to be performed and "Status" on the column of statuses

    Action column should include the following list of steps as text "Chest Item Created"
        "Treasure Choice Vendor Created"
        "Treasure Content Vendor Created"
        "Treasure Box to Choice Loot Created"
        "Treasure Choice to Content Loot Created"
        "Treasure Content Loots Created"
    <if Bonus Chest Checkbox was checked (these can always be there, should just be greyed out if not applicable)>
        "Bonus Chest Item Created"
        "Treasure BONUS Chance Vendor Created"
        "BONUS Treasure Box to Chance Loot Created"
        "Treasure Chance to Content Loot Created"
        "Zero Percent Drop Loot Created"

    The "Status" Title column should have the following status for each action:
        "Pending"
        "Processing"
        "Success"
        "Failure"
    There will also be icons for each of those statuses.  Create an icon folder in the program directory and I will put the files there.  There are names "Pending.png", "Processing.png", "Success.png", and "Failure.png"

    At the bottom of Screen 3 there should be two buttons that are greyed out until everything has finished.
        The first button "See Log" will open a log file of all the API calls and their returns.
        The second button "Exit" should return the user to Screen 1, with the input for "Treasure Chest Name", "Item List FIle", and "Bonus Chest Needed" cleared.
