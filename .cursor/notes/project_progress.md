# God Rotation Wizard - Progress Report

## Project Overview

The God Rotation Wizard is a Streamlit-based application for managing the active status of gods in SMITE 2 using the RallyHere API. The tool provides an intuitive interface for viewing the current rotation, selecting gods to activate or deactivate, and processing these updates with comprehensive logging.

## Development Journey

### Initial Setup and API Integration

1. **API Client Development**
   - Successfully implemented the RallyHereAPIClient class (renamed from the original ChestAPIClient)
   - Added authentication handling with proper header creation
   - Implemented logging for API requests and responses
   - Created reusable methods for GET/PUT operations

2. **Configuration Management**
   - Separated configuration into external JSON files
   - Implemented robust error handling for configuration loading
   - Made the application resilient to missing or invalid configuration

### UI Development with Streamlit

1. **Multi-screen Flow**
   - Implemented a 4-screen workflow (Welcome, Configuration, God Selection, Processing)
   - Developed state management between screens using Streamlit's session state
   - Added navigation controls for intuitive user flow

2. **God Selection Interface**
   - Created a clean UI for displaying gods with their active status
   - Implemented sorting options (A-Z, Z-A, by active status)
   - Added bulk operations (Check All, Uncheck All)
   - Enhanced the display of god names and status indicators

3. **Progress Tracking and Logging**
   - Added real-time progress bars for update operations
   - Implemented detailed error capture and display
   - Created comprehensive logging system with timestamp, operation details, and response data
   - Added log viewing and download functionality

### Technical Challenges Overcome

1. **API Integration Challenges**
   - Successfully navigated the RallyHere API requirements for updating loot items
   - Ensured proper handling of the complete loot object in PUT requests
   - Implemented robust error handling for API responses

2. **Streamlit Implementation Challenges**
   - Resolved issues with global variable scope in Streamlit
   - Fixed port conflicts in the application startup
   - Enhanced the startup script to find available ports automatically
   - Added debugging information to trace application flow

3. **Data Management Challenges**
   - Improved the handling of god data to ensure proper display of names
   - Enhanced the storage and retrieval of full god data for API updates
   - Implemented session state management for consistent data access

## Current Status

The application is now functional with the following capabilities:

1. **Authentication and Configuration**
   - Users can enter their auth token and sandbox ID
   - Configuration is properly loaded from external files

2. **God Selection**
   - The application successfully fetches and displays all gods from the vendor
   - Users can sort gods by name or status
   - Bulk check/uncheck functionality works properly
   - God names are correctly displayed with their active status

3. **Update Processing**
   - The application correctly identifies gods needing updates
   - Updates are processed with proper progress tracking
   - Success and errors are clearly displayed
   - Comprehensive logs are available for viewing and download

## Known Issues and Limitations

1. **Application Startup**
   - Occasionally, the Streamlit server may not start properly, requiring a restart of the run_app.py script
   - Browser connectivity issues may occur, requiring manual navigation to the provided URL

2. **API Limitations**
   - The application is dependent on the availability of the RallyHere API
   - Any changes to the API structure would require updates to the client code

3. **Data Display**
   - In some cases, god names may still display as UUIDs if the API does not provide name fields
   - Further testing is needed to ensure all gods are properly identified and updated

## Accomplishments

1. Successfully implemented a complete workflow for managing god rotations
2. Created a user-friendly interface for non-technical users
3. Implemented comprehensive error handling and logging
4. Developed a robust API client for RallyHere interactions
5. Added useful debugging features for troubleshooting

## Next Steps

1. **Quality of Life Improvements**
   - Add filtering options for gods by name or current status
   - Implement a confirmation screen before updates are processed
   - Add sorting options for the log display

2. **Technical Enhancements**
   - Consider implementing caching for API responses
   - Add unit tests for critical components
   - Create a dedicated debug mode with more verbose logging

3. **Documentation**
   - Add inline code documentation
   - Expand the troubleshooting guide
   - Add installation verification steps
